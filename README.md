# Wind Tunnel Smart Air Flow Stabilization System

## Overview
The **Wind Tunnel Smart Air Flow Stabilization System** is designed to ensure precise and stable airflow conditions within a wind tunnel by dynamically adjusting fan speed based on real-time feedback. This system employs a **flex sensor** to measure the angular displacement of a flap, which reflects airflow stability, and uses a **PID control algorithm** to maintain a consistent flap angle under varying conditions.

## Control Algorithm
The **PID Control Algorithm** operates as follows:
1. Continuously read the flex sensor output (flap angle).
2. Calculate the error: `Error = Desired Angle - Actual Angle`.
3. Apply the PID formula:
   ```
   PWM = Kp * Error + Ki * Integral(Error) + Kd * Derivative(Error)
   ```
4. Adjust fan speed using the PWM signal.

## Testing and Calibration
### Test Scenarios
1. **Initial Stability**:
   - Verify that the flap stays at the set angle under stable airflow conditions.

2. **External Disturbance**:
   - Introduce disturbances (e.g., sudden wind gusts) and observe system compensation.

3. **Set Point Adjustment**:
   - Test the ability to change the desired flap angle dynamically.

4. **Long-term Stability**:
   - Run the system for extended periods to ensure reliability.

### Calibration
- Tune the PID constants (**Kp**, **Ki**, **Kd**) for smooth and stable adjustments.
- Evaluate performance by plotting the flap angle over time.

## Results
The system successfully stabilizes airflow within the wind tunnel, ensuring the flap angle remains consistent even under external disturbances. The PID control loop allows for real-time compensation and smooth adjustments, achieving precise airflow conditions.
